# Document Usage Instructions

This document contains the updated files and source code for each version of the QIDI product, as well as two update methods:

1. Use the recommended packaging file to update the system through the machine's automatic update function  
2. Use the source code we provide to compile and update the source code through SSH connection to the microcontroller  

The detailed operation procedures for these two update methods will be written in this file, but let us know the directory composition of the document first, so that you can quickly know which folder you can find the files you need.
